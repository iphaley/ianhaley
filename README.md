# Code Sample

Some of code sample written by me

# Create a list with the following values: 6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11, 43, 1, 17, 27, 90, 77, 62, 51, 47, 82, 86, 20
values = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11, 43, 1, 17, 27, 90, 77, 62, 51, 47, 82, 86, 20]

# You will write code to do the following and print a report to the user.
# Determine how many numbers are in the list.
count = 0
for num in values:
    count += 1
print("There are", count, "numbers in the list")

# Calculate the sum of all numbers in the list.
total = 0
for num in values:
    total += num
print("Sum of all numbers in the list is", total)

# Calculate the average of all number in the list.
print("Average of all numbers in the list is", total / count)

# Use a While loop to print all the numbers in the list with their index values.
i = 0
while i < len(values):
    print("Value at index", i, "is", values[i])
    i += 1
print()

# Use a For loop and the range() function to print every other number in the list with their index values.
for i in range(0, len(values), 2):
    print("Value at index", i, "is", values[i])

```

### C code

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
// printf() displays the string inside quotation
printf("Hello, World!");
return 0;
